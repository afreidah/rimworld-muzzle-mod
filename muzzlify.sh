#  üêæ RimWorld Nuzzler Mod Generator (Advanced Version)                                   #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#  This script generates a RimWorld mod that enables the "nuzzling" behavior for animals  #
#  by injecting the `nuzzleMtbHours` XML field into their <race> definitions.             #
#                                                                                         #
#  NEW FEATURE:                                                                           #
#   ‚úî Supports setting a custom nuzzle interval per animal (in in-game hours) via args!   #
#                                                                                         #
#  WHAT IT DOES:                                                                          #
#   ‚úî Creates a valid RimWorld mod folder structure in your system's Mods/ directory:     #
#       Mods/<ModName>/                                                                   #

#         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Patches/NuzzlePatches.xml   ‚Üí Adds <nuzzleMtbHours> to animals              #
#                                                                                         #
#  WHAT IS `nuzzleMtbHours`?                                                              #
#   ‚Üí Mean Time Between nuzzling, in in-game hours. Lower = more frequent.                #
#   ‚Üí RimWorld uses this to probabilistically trigger nuzzles from animals to humans.     #
#                                                                                         #
#  USAGE:                                                                                 #

#  EXAMPLES:                                                                              #
#    ./gen_nuzzler.sh ZooSnugglers Muffalo:12 Elephant:36 Chicken                         #
#     ‚Üí Muffalo nuzzles every 12 hours, Elephant every 36, Chicken defaults to 24         #
#                                                                                         #
